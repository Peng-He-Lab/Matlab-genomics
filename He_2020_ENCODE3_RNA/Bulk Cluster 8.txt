Cluster 8 from hierarchical clustering analysis of bulk RNA samples. 
1.	The genes in Cluster 8 have increasing expression patterns in almost all tissues, although the kinetics of increase differ. 
2.	Top enriched GO terms include “inflammatory response” (p=1.0e-6) and “extracellular exosome” (p=1.5e-5).
3.	There are two major clades. The clade labeled in purple is consistent with genes marking the immune system, whose levels are highest in thymus and spleen, but also include expression in the hematopoietic fetal liver.  Subsets of these genes increase at later times in other tissues.  GO analysis called terms including “regulation of T cell activation” (p=8.8e-5) and “inflammatory response” (p=2.2e-5). The second major clade, labeled in blue, is dominated by increasing expression in liver and gut tissues. Top GO terms included “extracellular exosome” (p=3.3e-9).
