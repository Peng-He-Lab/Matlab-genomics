Cluster 19 from hierarchical clustering analysis of bulk RNA samples. 
1.	Genes in this cluster are mostly enriched in bladder, kidney, limb and neural tube. Within these tissues, expression levels are relatively constant over developmental time.
2.	The lower half of this cluster contains 5’ Hox genes (9-13) and lincRNAs localized in the 5’ region of Hox clusters (Hotair and Hottip). Genes with names beginning with “Gm” that are clustered together with Hox genes are also localized in 5’ Hox gene regions, suggesting shared transcriptional regulatory elements or RNA precursors. Among these Hox-cluster genes, there are distinctions, with 5’ Hox expression being more abundant in posterior tissues (e.g. bladder, kidney and intestine), consistent with previous findings.
3.	As the time course begins at E10.5, we could not follow the well-known upregulation sequence of Hox genes which displays “temporal co-linearity”, except for a gradual increase in Hoxc12 and Hoxc13 in the limb, which represent the distal ends of limbs and whose upregulation pattern is late enough to be captured in our time window. 
4.	In E14.5 neural tube samples the 5’ most Hox genes Hox11-13 are missing, because that batch of embryo dissections did not include the posterior tip of the tube.  
5.	Four major urinary protein (MUP) genes are enriched in limb, similar to the MUP paralogs in Cluster 2.  However, unlike those in Cluster 2, they are also enriched in early neural tube samples.
