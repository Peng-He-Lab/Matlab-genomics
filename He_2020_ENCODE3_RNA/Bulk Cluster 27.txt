Cluster 27 from hierarchical clustering analysis of bulk RNA samples. 
1.	Cluster 27 contains genes highly enriched in kidney. Most are also expressed in brain and neural tube at later stages but less abundantly than in kidney.
2.	Pax2, Pax8 and their target Gata3 are found in this cluster which specify the nephric lineage and regulate branching morphogenesis in the developing kidney. Pax2 and Pax8 are also reported to specify GABAergic and glycinergic neuronal fates, partly explaining expression in the hindbrain and neural tube. Itâ€™s possible that this cluster concerns two independent cell fate specification and morphogenesis programs that use overlapping regulatory factor sets, such as Pax2 and 8 and Gata3.
