Cluster 6 from hierarchical clustering analysis of bulk RNA samples. 
1.	The unifying theme of this cluster is high expression in the adrenal gland.
2.	Top GO terms include “hormone biosynthetic process” (p=1.5e-7) and “hormone metabolic process” (p=7.3e-7).  More specifically, Cyp11b1, Cyp21a1 and Cyp11b2 contribute to the term “mineralocorticoid biosynthetic process” (p=2.8e-7). These cytochrome P450 genes are involved in biosynthesis of aldosterone which, unlike many other hormones, is produced only in the adrenal gland.  However, these genes also have detectable expression signals in E15.5 and E16.5 samples of kidney. Their presence at E15.5 and E16.5 stages and absence in E14.5 and P0 may be due to contamination in E15.5 and E16.5 pooled samples, while E14.5 and P0 samples from individual embryos were more contamination-free.
