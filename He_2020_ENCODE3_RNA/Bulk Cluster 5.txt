Cluster 5 from hierarchical clustering analysis of bulk RNA samples. 
1.	Genes in Cluster 5 are very prominently expressed in thymus and most have minimal expression in other tissues. 
2.	Highly expressed genes also have positive signals in several non-thymus samples, with atypical irreproducibility between replicates.  A candidate explanation is batch-specific contamination of thymus-proximate tissues with thymus during dissection. While this kind of contamination doesn’t greatly alter global QC scores, it is readily detectable in this clustering analysis (see also CCA analysis).
3.	GO analysis revealed enrichment in later stage maturing immune components, especially T-cell terms. Top terms include “immune system process” (p=1.8e-18) and “regulation of T-cell activation” (p=3.0e-13). 
4.	Roughly one quarter of the genes are T-cell receptor components (alpha chain, gamma chain and delta chain). Interestingly, the two recombinases Rag1 and Rag2 are also in this cluster, indicating a TCR VDJ theme for this cluster.
