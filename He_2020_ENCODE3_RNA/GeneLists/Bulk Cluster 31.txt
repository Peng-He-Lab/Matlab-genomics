Cluster 31 from hierarchical clustering analysis of bulk RNA samples. 
1.	Genes in Cluster 31 are mainly enriched in brain and neural tube, with different regionalization for subclusters, plus the facial prominence (perhaps partly driven by cross-contamination of face with forebrain dissection at early times). 
2.	More than a third of the genes in this cluster are transcription factors (“sequence-specific DNA binding”, p=1.0e-26), most of which also contribute to the GO term “neuron differentiation” (p=4.4e-18). It is likely that this group of genes are involved in neuron maturation, such as Dlx1, Dlx2 and Helt which specifies GABAergic neuron differentiation. Genes responsible for cerebral cortex GABAergic interneuron migration (Lhx6, Arx and Fezf2) are also found in this cluster.
