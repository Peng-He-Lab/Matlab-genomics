Cluster 7 from hierarchical clustering analysis of bulk RNA samples. 
1.	The central theme of this cluster is prominent expression in the developing kidney, where the RNA trajectories generally increase over time. Roughly 40% of these genes are also expressed in liver, again with increasing trajectories, plus some smaller subclades that are shared with gut or lung samples.
2.	Top GO terms of this cluster include transporter-related categories such as “sodium ion transport” (p=2.0e-14) and “anion transport” (p=4.7e-9) and structural terms like “apical plasma membrane”. This cluster is dominated by genes responsible for transporter machinery and epithelial cell organization in the kidney.  This cluster was also highlighted by CCA analysis.  Further examination found that the increasing number of nephrons through time, and the up-regulation, in particular, of genes of the proximal tubule are explanatory.
3.	The clade of 72 genes labeled in purple contains genes enriched in both liver and kidney. The top enriched GO terms for this group are for amino acid catabolic processes performed in both liver and kidney (“organic acid metabolic process” (p=7.7e-12), “fatty acid metabolic process” (p=1.2e-7) and “alpha-amino acid catabolic process” (p=1.5e-6).  20 of these genes are enriched in kidney proximal tubule brush border cells while 7 are enriched in hepatocytes12.
