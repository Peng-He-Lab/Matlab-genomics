Cluster 18 from hierarchical clustering analysis of bulk RNA samples.
1.	Most genes in Cluster 18 are enriched in the craniofacial prominence at early stages but not later. 
2.	Its top GO terms mainly concern eye development, including “structural constituent of eye lens” (p=1.6e-17) and “eye development” (p=1.1e-15). Genes include crystallins, retinoic acid-metabolizing enzymes (Cyp26a1 and Cyp26c1), lens membrane protein (Lim2), melanin regulators (Tyrp1, Tyr and Pmel) and one developmental regulator (Vax2). 
3.	The dissection plan for cranioface was to exclude the eyes, but at earlier stages it appears not to have been fully successful. The expression pattern and Gene Ontology, of Cluster 18 genes in the early craniofacial prominence samples (E10.5, E11.5 and E12.5), including sharp transitions between adjacent timepoints, are likely due to imperfect removal of early eyes.  Sporadic enrichment of these genes in later stage craniofacial prominence samples (E16.5) is likely due to a few imperfect dissections in a large embryo pool.
