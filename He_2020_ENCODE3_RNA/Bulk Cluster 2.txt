Cluster 2 from hierarchical clustering analysis of bulk RNA samples. 
1.	Cluster 2 has prominent expression in skeletal muscle and an increasing trajectory in limb and craniofacial prominence. 
2.	Cluster 2 contains multiple muscle regulators like Myod1 and Myog. Its top GO terms include “muscle system process” (p=4.5e-18) and “contractile fiber part” (p=9.9e-14). The increasing expression in limb and craniofacial prominence is likely due to differentiation of muscle precursors and to increasing relative muscle mass as a fraction of the total tissue.
3.	In addition to the dominant muscle-limb-face feature, there are two clades with different patterns that illustrate the informational leverage that comes from a more pure P0 dissected tissue (here muscle).
a.	The clade of 13 genes labeled in blue have increasing expression in limb and craniofacial prominence but not in the P0 pure skeletal muscle sample.  Among the 13 genes, five (Dcstamp, Mmp13, Bglap, Ifitm5 and Ibsp) are associated in prior work with osteogenesis. 
b.	The clade of 13 other genes labeled in purple is biased for limb alone, and not cranioface. It includes four major urinary protein (MUP) genes at low but detectable abundance. The mouse genome has 21 annotated Mup genes in a 2Mb cluster on Chromosome 4.  Although none have human orthologs, members of the family have known functions in mouse chemical communication and nutrient metabolism.  A recent study reported dramatic and unexpected upregulation of Mup1 in mouse embryos when Sox2, a transcription factor regulating proximal bone formation in limbs, is mutated. This raises the possibility that the MUPs in this limb cluster play a role in limb development. 
4.	** Technical user note: Sporadic samples of adrenal gland, kidney, lung, stomach, hindbrain and neural tube from this mouse embryo bulk RNA ENCODE series show slight enrichments for genes from this cluster, implying variable minor tissue contamination during dissection.
